# PoolPal
PoolPal is a mobile and progressive web application built for users to track and manage their pool maintenance activities. It is built on version 5 of the Ionic framework.

This repository contains code for the front-end of the application. Below is a link to the repository containing the code for the service-layer:

When opening the application for the first time, users will be presented with a set of introductory slides:

Local storage is used to determine if the user has seen the slides before or not and ensures they are only presented with the slides once.

The user is then presented with the general login screen:

From here the user can log-in or click on the button to register a new account:
